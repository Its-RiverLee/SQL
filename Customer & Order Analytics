#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 

#1. How many orders were placed in January? 
SELECT COUNT (orderID) 
FROM bit_db.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'ORDER ID';

#2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone? 
SELECT COUNT (orderID) 
FROM bit_db.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'ORDER ID'
AND Product = 'iPhone';

#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February. 
SELECT DISTINCT acctnum
FROM bit_db.customers
INNER JOIN FebSales
ON febSales.orderID = customers.order_id
WHERE length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';;

#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price? 
SELECT Product, MIN(price)
FROM Bit_db.JanSales 
GROUP BY product, price
ORDER BY price ASC
LIMIT 1;

#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT Product, ROUND(sum(quantity)*price,2) AS revenue
FROM bit_db.JanSales
GROUP BY product
ORDER BY revenue ASC;

#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT Product, SUM(quantity), ROUND(sum(quantity)*price,2) AS revenue
FROM bit_DB.FebSales
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY product;

#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time, and what was the average amount spent for those customers? 
SELECT COUNT(Distinct cust.acctnum) AS Customers, ROUND(AVG(quantity*price), 2) AS AVG_Spent
FROM bit_DB.FebSales Feb
LEFT JOIN Bit_DB.customers cust
ON feb.orderID = cust.order_ID
WHERE length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'
AND Feb.quantity > 2;
